# Avid DocuWorks Base Setup

## NOTE - THIS DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE DUE TO REQUIRING SSL AND CERTBOT.
### I'll make a dev version soon. Anyhow, this is all garbage now:


- Make sure docker and docker-compose are installed
- Run  `docker-compose up --build`
- Go to http://localhost:8080
- During setup, use the credentials supplied - OR, modify docker-compose.yml with the info you want and adjust accordingly
- Follow the instructions, and you should be all set!
- NOTE - This is got local development only - You'll want to install SSL for production
